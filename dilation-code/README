TimeKeeper has been tested with Ubuntu 12.04 32-bit and 64-bit with Linux kernel version 3.10.9

Outlined below are basic instructions. See the installation/usage guide found in the documentation directory for additional assistance.

1. Install the kernel modifications:
	- ./kernel_setup
		The kernel_setup script will download Linux Kernel version 3.10.9, and store it in /src directory. 
		Then it will modify the source code with the necessary changes.
	- Compile the kernel. I have followed the instructions outlined in: http://mitchtech.net/compile-linux-kernel-on-ubuntu-12-04-lts-detailed/.


2. Install Core
	- ./core_setup.sh
		The core_setup script will install necessary packages to run CORE, the compile and install CORE on your system. 
		You should not already have CORE installed on the system


3. Make and install kernel module
	- python setup_module.py
		Run the python script on follow the instructions. It will ask you how many EXP_CPUS you want to contribute to the experiment.
		Be sure not assign every vCPU on your system to TimeKeeper.		
	- sudo insmod ./TimeKeeper.ko

From here, TimeKeeper should be installed, loaded into the Linux Kernel, and good to go!
